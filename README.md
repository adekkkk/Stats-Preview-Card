## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The main challenge for this project is understanding the use of CSS to align elements in their desired positions. Having been exposed to a project with no backup code or even example code was very challenging in itself. Being provided with only a screenshot on how the page should look like and the fonts used was challenging in itself. Being able to create this page was a proud achievement in itself. I believe that I have managed to mimic the provided design quite accurately.


### Continued development

As part of my continued development there's a major focus that need to be put on use of CSS to style the pages. This was my first attempt at such project and that have showed me which skills I'm lacking and what I should improve on.

The main focus for now will be definitely working on more projects and keep on practising the knowledge I have acquired through doing this challenge.
Main areas of focus would be;
- Working with CSS Flexbox and CSS grid alongside
- Understanding the importance of semantic html and CSS
- Focusing on practice and different approaches to a set problem

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid (data tables)](https://medium.com/evodeck/responsive-data-tables-with-css-grid-3c58ecf04723) - This helped me understand the CSS grid and how it can be used to create a responsive data tables. Even though this project did not include data tables, it helped me to understand the CSS grid itself.
- [Complete guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article that came in handy to explain the properties and uses of flexbox when styling a web-page. I would highly recommend it to anyone that experiments with it as it gives a great insight on how flexbox can be used in your project.
